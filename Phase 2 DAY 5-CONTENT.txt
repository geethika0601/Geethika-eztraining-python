Binary tree:
a node can have maximum 2 children


binary tree traversal:
1. pre order - root-left-right(DLR)
2. in order - left-root-right(LDR)
3. post-order - left-right-root(LRD)

BFS breadth first search
DFS depth first search

BINARY TREE TYPES:
1. full tree-nodes having 0 or 2 children 
2. pathological tree or degenerate tree- nodes having 0 or 1 children
3. skewed tree
   1.left- all nodes are represented towards left
   2.right- all nodes are represented towards right

complete binary tree-
conditions:
1.every level should be full except the leaf node
2.in last level if it is incomplete nodes should present at extreme left

perfect binary tree
conditions:
1. all the internal nodes has two children and
2. leaf nodes at both sides should be at same level

balanced tree:
for all the nodes (height of left sub tree ) - (height of right sub tree) can be 0 or 1

BST:
all the left side ele should be less than root
all the right side ele should be more than root
